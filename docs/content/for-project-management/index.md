## 📋 Project Planning Guides

### [Component Mapping Guide](./for-project-management/guide-mapping-project-components-to-fastlane-components.md)
Comprehensive guide for identifying project requirements and mapping them to existing FastLane components. Includes:
- Component assessment process and decision matrix
- Project planning templates and worksheets
- Timeline and resource estimation guidelines
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

## 🎯 Project Management Workflow

1. **Requirements Gathering**: Document functional and design requirements
2. **Component Assessment**: Map requirements to FastLane component library
3. **Decision Making**: Determine reuse vs. custom development approach
4. **Resource Planning**: Estimate effort and timeline based on component decisions
5. **Risk Management**: Identify and mitigate project risks early
6. **Stakeholder Communication**: Keep teams aligned on component strategy

## 📊 Key Benefits

### **Development Acceleration**
- **Faster Initial Setup**: Start with a working component library instead of building from scratch
- **Reduced Development Effort**: Leverage pre-built components for common patterns (navigation, forms, cards, etc.)
- **Focus on Customization**: Spend time adapting existing components rather than creating everything new
- **Predictable Delivery**: Clearer effort estimation when working with established component patterns
- **Reduced UI Development Risk**: Battle-tested components minimize bugs and edge cases

### **Cost Optimization**
- **Resource Efficiency**: Avoid rebuilding components that already exist
- **Quality Consistency**: Maintain design system standards across projects
- **Maintenance Reduction**: Centralized updates benefit all projects

### **Team Collaboration**
- **Clear Communication**: Shared vocabulary between business and technical teams
- **Decision Framework**: Structured approach to component vs. custom decisions
- **Documentation Standards**: Consistent project planning and tracking

## 🛠️ Planning Tools & Templates

### **Assessment Tools**
- Component mapping worksheets
- Decision matrix templates
- Risk assessment frameworks
- Effort estimation guides

### **Communication Templates**
- Stakeholder update formats
- Technical assessment requests
- Budget impact summaries
- Timeline adjustment notifications

## 📈 Success Metrics

Track these KPIs to measure FastLane adoption success:

| Metric | Target | Benefit |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **Component Reuse Rate** | >70% | Faster development |
| **Development Velocity** | +40% improvement | Earlier delivery |
| **Quality Consistency** | -50% design issues | Better user experience |
| **Budget Efficiency** | -30% development costs | Cost savings |

## 🚦 Decision Framework

### **When to Use FastLane Components**
- ✅ Requirements align 80%+ with existing components
- ✅ Standard business functionality needed
- ✅ Budget/timeline constraints require efficiency
- ✅ Brand customization achievable through theming

### **When to Build Custom Components**
- ❌ Unique business logic or regulatory requirements
- ❌ Specialized data structures not supported
- ❌ Client insists on completely custom design
- ❌ Long-term strategic component for multiple projects
