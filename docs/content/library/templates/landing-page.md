# Landing Page

**Landing Page:** A standalone entry page (e.g., homepage) with a comprehensive layout as described. The Landing Page template is a core component of the FastLane Website built on Sitecore, inheriting properties and fields from the base "Page" template.

This template is tailored to create high-impact entry pages that effectively communicate the brand message, engage visitors, and guide them toward desired actions.

*   **Structure**: Includes a hero area, modular content sections, and visual elements like images and buttons.
    
*   **Use Case**: Ideal for homepages or campaign landing pages (e.g., Midwest Care home page).
