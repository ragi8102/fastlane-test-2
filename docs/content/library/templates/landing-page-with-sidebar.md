# Landing Page with Sidebar

**Landing Page with Sidebar**: The Landing Page with Sidebar template, inherited from the base "Page" template in Sitecore, is a variant of the Landing Page template designed to include a sidebar alongside the main content. This layout features a hero section with a headline, subtext, and CTA, similar to the standard Landing Page, but incorporates a vertical sidebar on one side.

The sidebar can house navigation links, quick access items, or additional information, while the main content area includes sections for thought leadership, solutions, and other key information.

*   **Structure**: Features a hero section, main content areas, and a sidebar with links or quick access items.
    
*   **Use Case**: Suitable for entry pages requiring additional navigation (e.g., service overview pages).
