# Team Workflow

**Complete project lifecycle and team collaboration process for FastLane projects.**

## Overview

FastLane projects follow a structured workflow that combines traditional development practices with AI-powered component generation and customer-specific customization capabilities.

## **Available Workflows**

### ✅ Customer Component Customization (Available Now)

**Process**: Rapidly customize existing FastLane components to match customer designs while preserving all Sitecore functionality.

**When to use**: When you have base FastLane components and need to apply customer branding/styling.

**Key phases**:
1. **Design Preparation**: Copy FastLane components and apply customer styling in Figma
2. **New Component Creation**: Use [Create Component Guide](../for-developers/component-development/ai-prompts/guide-using-create-component-prompt) for components that don't exist in FastLane yet
3. **Existing Component Enhancement**: Use [Enhancement Guide](../for-developers/component-development/ai-prompts/guide-using-enhance-component-prompt) to customize existing FastLane components while preserving functionality
4. **Integration & Testing**: Validate Sitecore functionality and content author workflows
5. **Documentation & Handoff**: Generate change summaries and team materials

**Success criteria**: Visual fidelity + functional preservation + content author experience + performance + accessibility + documentation completeness

**Timeline**: Customer components ready in hours, not weeks

> **📚 Detailed Guide**: See [Enhance Component Guide](../for-developers/component-development/ai-prompts/guide-using-enhance-component-prompt) for complete step-by-step process.
